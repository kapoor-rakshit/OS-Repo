1. Initialization phase to set up the environment.

The shell checks to see whether the file /etc/profile exists.
The shell checks to see whether the file .profile exists in your home directory. 

As soon as both of these files have been read, the shell displays a prompt âˆ’ $


2. PS1 and PS2 Variables

The characters that the shell displays as your command prompt "$" default, are stored in the variable PS1.
You can change this variable by :
PS1=" <your symbol> "
PS1="\u@\h:\w\#$"                          //with escape sequences      example   \# to get count of commands

Escape Sequence & Description   :        https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/unix-environment.htm

The default secondary prompt is > (the greater than sign), but can be changed by re-defining the PS2 shell variable.
PS2=" <your symbol> "


3. env command

env
# It can be used to print a list of the current environment variables, or to run another program in a custom environment without modifying the current one.
example : $LOGNAME , $USER , $LANG , $SHELL, $PATH      more at : https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/unix-environment.htm

env --version                                           # Display version information and exit.


4. uptime command
   uptime tells you how long the system has been running.
   uptime gives a one-line display of the following information:
The current time
how long the system has been running
how many users are currently logged on
the system load averages for the past 1, 5, and 15 minutes.  as  03:59:57 up 20 days, 14:03, 1 user, load avg:0.13,0.07,0.15


5. Some hacks

ctrl + a   :   move to beginning of command on terminal
ctrl + e   :   move to end of command on terminal
alt + .    :   use args of prev command in history as args to current command, repeated press changes args.

6. set command

set -o           :   check status of shell options
set -o vi        :   -o : set on ,  editor mode as vi
set +o noclobber :   +o : set off , noclobber option used to prevent overwriting of files
set -x           :   -x : set on xtrace


7. export command
#  the export command marks an environment variable to be exported with any newly forked child processes and thus it allows a child process to inherit all marked variables.

export          :   view all the exported variables.
export -p       :   -p : view all exported variables on current shell
unset varname   :   unexport a variable


8. exit status
checked using `echo $?` the exit status of last command executed

0   : ok
1   : error
2   : wrong usage
126 : not executable...permission denied
127 : command not found


9. SHELL CONFIG
a file home/.bashrc found at HOME dir is to be configured for user defined settings of shell.
eg : echo "Today is `date`"


10. ALIAS NAMING
commands can be aliased with a simpler ver.

alias ..="cd .."              # "cd .." aliased as .. , here .. performs same as cd ..
unalias ..                    # remove alias name


11. HISTORY
~/.bash_history               # file contains history of all commands
!-n                           # execute nth command from history
!string                       # execute most recent command matching string as a substring or whole of command
