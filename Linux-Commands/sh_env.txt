The shell checks to see whether the file /etc/profile exists.
The shell checks to see whether the file .profile exists in your home directory. 

As soon as both of these files have been read, the shell displays a prompt âˆ’ $


2. PS1 and PS2 Variables

The characters that the shell displays as your command prompt "$" default, are stored in the variable PS1.
You can change this variable by :
PS1=" <your symbol> "
PS1="\u@\h:\w\#$"                          //with escape sequences      example   \# to get count of commands
